# Postmortem: React Error #185 - Mobile Workspace Infinite Update Loop

**Date**: July 19, 2025  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: Resolved  
**Duration**: ~2 hours  

## Summary

A React error #185 (infinite update loop) occurred when opening the mobile file tree panel in the workspace management feature. The error prevented mobile users from accessing the file tree and workspace switching functionality, while desktop users were unaffected.

## Timeline

- **Initial Implementation**: Workspace management feature implemented with dropdown-based UI
- **User Feedback**: "no. make it like sign in sign out. must be left workspace to join another"
- **Redesign**: Implemented session-based workspace management with sign-in/sign-out workflow
- **Desktop Testing**: All functionality working correctly
- **Mobile Issue Report**: "still not something went wrong on mobile. try to use playwright and screenshot when open the left panel in explorer"
- **Error Discovery**: React error #185 identified when opening mobile Sheet dialog
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Infinite update loop in useWorkspaceManager hook
- **Resolution**: Fixed dependency loops and function interface mismatches

## What Happened

### The Problem
When users tapped the mobile menu button to open the file tree panel, the application would display "Something went wrong!" error screen instead of the expected file tree with workspace management interface.

### Technical Details
- **Error**: React error #185 - "Maximum update depth exceeded"
- **Location**: Mobile Sheet dialog containing FileTree component
- **Scope**: Mobile-only issue, desktop unaffected
- **User Impact**: Complete inability to access file tree and workspace switching on mobile devices

## Why It Happened

### Root Causes

#### 1. **useEffect Dependency Loop**
```tsx
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
useEffect(() => {
  loadWorkspace(workspaceId)
}, [loadWorkspace]) // loadWorkspace changes on every render
```

The `useWorkspaceManager` hook had a circular dependency where:
- `useEffect` depended on `loadWorkspace`
- `loadWorkspace` was recreated on every render due to its own dependencies
- This created an infinite re-render cycle

#### 2. **Function Interface Mismatches**
```tsx
// ExplorerHeader expected:
onDeleteItem: (path: string) => void

// FileTree expected:
onDeleteItem: (item: FileSystemItem) => void
```

Type mismatches between component interfaces caused React to detect unstable prop changes, contributing to the infinite loop.

#### 3. **Recursive Function Dependencies**
```tsx
// Workspace functions called each other recursively
const joinWorkspace = useCallback(() => {
  loadWorkspace(id) // Creates dependency chain
}, [loadWorkspace])
```

Functions like `joinWorkspace`, `leaveWorkspace`, and `createWorkspace` all depended on `loadWorkspace`, creating a complex dependency graph that React couldn't stabilize.

#### 4. **Mobile-Specific Component Lifecycle**
- **Desktop**: FileTree component is always mounted (persistent sidebar)
- **Mobile**: FileTree is mounted/unmounted when Sheet dialog opens/closes
- **Issue**: Re-mounting triggered fresh hook initialization, amplifying the dependency loop problem

### Contributing Factors

1. **Partial Prop Passing**: Workspace props could be undefined during initialization
2. **Unstable Function References**: Functions recreated on every render in mobile context
3. **Missing Memoization**: Expensive operations repeated unnecessarily

## How We Fixed It

### 1. **Eliminated useEffect Dependency Loop**
```tsx
// BEFORE
useEffect(() => {
  loadWorkspace(workspaceId)
}, [loadWorkspace])

// AFTER
useEffect(() => {
  // Inline workspace loading logic
  const workspaceKey = `${WORKSPACE_DATA_PREFIX}${workspaceId}`
  const stored = localStorage.getItem(workspaceKey)
  // Direct localStorage operations without function dependencies
}, []) // Empty dependency array
```

### 2. **Fixed Function Interface Mismatches**
```tsx
// Created stable wrapper functions
const handleDeleteItem = useCallback((item: FileSystemItem) => {
  onDeleteItem(item.path) // Convert FileSystemItem to path
}, [onDeleteItem])

const handleRenameItem = useCallback((item: FileSystemItem, newName: string) => {
  onRenameItem(item.path, newName)
}, [onRenameItem])
```

### 3. **Replaced Recursive Calls with Direct Operations**
```tsx
// BEFORE
const joinWorkspace = useCallback((workspaceId: string) => {
  if (workspaceData) saveWorkspace(workspaceData)
  loadWorkspace(workspaceId) // Recursive call
}, [workspaceData, saveWorkspace, loadWorkspace])

// AFTER
const joinWorkspace = useCallback((workspaceId: string) => {
  if (workspaceData) saveWorkspace(workspaceData)
  
  // Direct localStorage operations
  const workspaceKey = `${WORKSPACE_DATA_PREFIX}${workspaceId}`
  const stored = localStorage.getItem(workspaceKey)
  if (stored) {
    const data = JSON.parse(stored) as WorkspaceData
    setWorkspaceData(data)
    setCurrentWorkspaceId(workspaceId)
  }
}, [workspaceData, saveWorkspace]) // Removed loadWorkspace dependency
```

### 4. **Added Conditional Prop Passing**
```tsx
// Only pass workspace props when fully defined
const memoizedWorkspaceProps = useMemo(() => {
  if (currentWorkspaceId && currentWorkspaceName && workspaces && 
      onWorkspaceJoin && onWorkspaceLeave && onWorkspaceCreate) {
    return {
      currentWorkspaceId,
      currentWorkspaceName,
      workspaces,
      onWorkspaceJoin,
      onWorkspaceLeave,
      onWorkspaceCreate
    }
  }
  return {} // Prevent partial renders
}, [currentWorkspaceId, currentWorkspaceName, workspaces, ...])
```

### 5. **Stabilized All Function References**
```tsx
// Added useCallback to all handlers
const handleFileSelect = useCallback((item: FileSystemItem) => {
  onFileSelect(item)
  setIsMobileSheetOpen(false)
}, [onFileSelect, setIsMobileSheetOpen])
```

## Prevention Measures

### Testing Improvements
1. **Mobile-Specific Testing**: Created dedicated mobile test that specifically opens Sheet dialogs
2. **Error Boundary Testing**: Tests now verify no React errors occur during mobile interactions
3. **Cross-Platform Validation**: Ensure features work on both desktop and mobile before deployment

### Code Quality Guidelines
1. **Hook Dependencies**: Always minimize useEffect dependencies, prefer direct operations over function calls
2. **Function Interfaces**: Ensure consistent interfaces between parent and child components
3. **Memoization**: Use useCallback/useMemo for all functions passed as props
4. **Conditional Rendering**: Guard against partial prop passing with proper conditionals

### Development Process
1. **Progressive Testing**: Test mobile implementation immediately after desktop completion
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Review hook dependency arrays for potential circular references
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Watch for infinite re-render patterns during development

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **Mobile vs Desktop Differences**: Component mounting/unmounting behavior differs significantly between platforms
2. **React Hook Dependencies**: Circular dependencies in useCallback/useEffect can create subtle infinite loops
3. **Type Safety**: Interface mismatches can cause runtime instability even when TypeScript compiles successfully

### Process Improvements
1. **Mobile-First Testing**: Mobile testing should be integrated into the development workflow, not an afterthought
2. **Cross-Platform Parity**: Features should be tested on both platforms before considering them complete
3. **Error Boundary Monitoring**: React errors in production should be monitored and alerted

### Prevention Strategies
1. **Dependency Audits**: Regular review of hook dependencies to identify potential circular references
2. **Interface Consistency**: Establish clear patterns for component interfaces to prevent type mismatches
3. **Memoization Standards**: Standard practices for when and how to use useCallback/useMemo
